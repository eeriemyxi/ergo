# Ergo

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A work in progress.

Ergo is an attempt at a shell language that is designed with ease of use in mind
for smartphone users. Please have a look under [`samples/`](samples/) for
examples. For now the implementation will be done in Python, however if the
attempt succeeds, it will eventually will be ported to Kotlin for use with
Android SDK.
